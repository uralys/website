    - paragraph: 'I managed to find 10 hours that weekend to push an entry. Somehow it was even an advantage not to use these 48h: I was definitely pushed to remove stuffs as the time passed.'
    - list:
        - I wanted many rules, (only one remained at the end)
        - I wanted a leaderboard (but I would have used stuffs already coded)
        - I wanted music and sounds (guess what)
    - paragraph: 'You have 10 clicks to destroy the blocks. Try to reach more than 1024 points.'
